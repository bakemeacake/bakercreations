                    <h2>Design</h2>
				    <p>I have always loved art and creating attractive images, however my creations lacked purpose until I became interested in design specifically. Time is essential in our world and I love creating images that can communicate a concept within a matter of seconds.</p>

                    <h2>Photography</h2>
				    <p>Although I enjoy photography and I am willing to do photoshoots, my main focus is design. My knowledge of photography has and continues to improve my design prowess; it helps me understand composition and perspective for designs as well as allowing me to use original, attractive images in ads and websites etc.</p>
