                <p>You probably read a little about me already from the home page, but I’ll just give you a little more background. My name is Megan Baker, as you can probably tell. Right now, I am living in Little Elm, Texas, which is just north of Dallas and within the DFW area. I just graduated Brigham Young University-Idaho with my Bachelor’s in Visual Communications. While I usually describe my major as practically being graphic design, I do think it was important that it focused on the business and communication side of designing, as most of my project purposes will be to communicate. I would love to do design work for anyone within the DFW area, but I am also willing to work remotely, meaning that I can design for you no matter where you are. I am excited to start new projects and help other people communicate through visuals.</p>
                <p>The following form sends an email directly to me and contains questions that I would ask any client for a design or photography project respectively. Some questions may apply more to specific projects, but I ask that you please answer all of them. I may have further questions when I respond to you, depending on your desired project.</p>
