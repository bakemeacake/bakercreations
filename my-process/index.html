				<h2>Design</h2>
				<p>My process for any design project consists of three main steps: research, sketching and designing.</p>
                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>Researching for a design project usually involves looking through Pinterest, design websites and other visual images. The idea is to understand the look of something in order to recreate it in an original way. For example, if I had a logo project for cotton balls and I wanted to use a sheep, I may look through pictures of sheep to completely understand the aspects that make sheep recognizable. Then, I can use those aspects to best communicate that the logo is a sheep. Depending on the project this process can be short or long, but no more than a few days.</p>
                <h3>Sketching</h3>
                <p>The sketching process is the main planning stage for any project. Sketching focuses on getting ideas on a page before beginning to design. Starting in a design program can sometimes hinder ideas because of a lack of vision and the program’s capabilities. However, starting with sketching hones in on the best idea and creates it in graphite, making the transfer to technology easier. As a result, the designer can push through the program capabilities and find a way to create the design the way it was drawn or better. Sketching makes what once might have seemed impossible, possible and helps define the vision that will keep elements clean, organized and not over complicated. (In a website project, sketching may be replaced with simple wireframe designing.)</p>
                <h3>Designing</h3>
                <p>Designing usually starts in Illustrator with any graphics that need to be created. Most likely, they are designed in gray scale to determine the shape, composition and shades that best suit the graphics for their purposes. Color is added later to prevent distraction from the graphic’s overall look. The project will move into InDesign for layout and organization of ads or posters. The design process takes the longest, but it is also when all of the magic happens.</p>

				<h2 class="white">Photography</h2>
				<p>My process for any photography shoot consists of three main steps: client meeting and research, the photoshoot and editing.</p>
                <h3 class="white">Client Meeting and Research</h3>
                <p>Photoshoots generally begin by meeting with the client to discuss location and date of the photoshoot (for portraits), as well as the kind of positions or look desired in the photoshoot. Client meetings should only last thirty minutes to an hour and are planned a few days in advance of the photoshoot to allow time for research in between. Research for a photoshoot involves studying similar photos to gain inspiration to make each picture the best quality for the client.</p>
                <h3 class="white">Photoshoot</h3>
                <p>A photoshoot is pretty self-explanatory. The photographer travels to the location or prepares to capture images of the subject, then takes the pictures. Photoshoots shouldn’t last more than a couple of hours depending on the parameters of the specific photoshoot and the number of images required.</p>
                <h3 class="white">Editing</h3>
                <p>The editing process is the most time-consuming part of a photoshoot. Involved in the process is sifting through to find the best selection of pictures to meet the client’s needs. Then, each picture is examined and improved to amplify the beauty of the image and enhance the composition. The editing time frame changes as a result of the number of pictures required.</p>
